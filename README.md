## Development (fantasygame team)
* Make sure that you have your email and name set in git on your machine. It won't recognize your commits if you don't do this. https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/
* Make sure to connect your machine to github by ssh https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/
* Don't fork the project. We use one-repo single-branch approach for rapid development.
* Every commit is reviewed by the other team member. Make sure to fix any issue that is found.
* We use rubocop to mantain high code quality. Make sure to follow its advices. Install rubocop plugin to your editor.
* Make your best to write tests for your code. You can check code coverage in codeclimate.
* We don't like merge commits. Use rebase. `bash git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always`
* Be aware that every push is deploying to heroku
